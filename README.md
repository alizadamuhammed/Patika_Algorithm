# Project 1

[22,27,16,2,18,6] -> First 3 question is about for this array

**Question 1:**
Steps to sort this array:
1. [16,22,27,2,18,6]
2. [2,16,22,27,18,6]
3. [2,16,18,22,27,6]
4. [2,6,16,18,22,27] -> Final state

**Question 2:**
Big-O Notation:
Best Case -> O(n)
Worth case -> O(n<sup>2</sup>)
Average case -> O(n<sup>2</sup>)

**Question 3:**
After sorting this array, 18 is suitable for the avarage case.
