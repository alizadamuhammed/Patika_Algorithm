# Project 1

[22,27,16,2,18,6] -> First 3 question is about for this array

**Question 1:**
Steps to sort this array:
1. [16,22,27,2,18,6]
2. [2,16,22,27,18,6]
3. [2,16,18,22,27,6]
4. [2,6,16,18,22,27] -> Final state

**Question 2:**
Big-O Notation:
Best Case -> O(n)
Worth case -> O(n<sup>2</sup>)
Average case -> O(n<sup>2</sup>)

**Question 3:**
After sorting this array, 18 is suitable for the avarage case.

**Question 4:**
First 4 insertion sort steps of this array: [7,3,5,8,2,9,4,15,6]
1. [3,7,5,8,2,9,4,15,6]
2. [3,5,7,8,2,9,4,15,6]
3. [2,3,5,7,8,9,4,15,6]
4. [2,3,4,5,7,8,9,15,6]


# Project 2

[16,21,11,8,12,22]  -> All 2 question is about for this array

**Question 1:**
1. [16,21,11]-[8,12,22]
2. [16,21]-[11]-[8,12]-[22]
3. [16]-[21]-[11]-[8]-[12]-[22]
4. [11,16,21]-[8,12,22]
5. [8,11,12,16,21,22] - Final state

**Question 2:**
In all situations the Big-O notation of Merge Sort is O(nlogn)


# Project 3

**Question:**
[7,5,1,8,3,6,0,9,4,2]

Let's say 7 is the root:
The right side is root is bigger than root, left side is smaller.
